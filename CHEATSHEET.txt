## Weapons

### Chili Bullet

A chili bullet serves as ammunition for chili bullet guns and can be crafted from a bullet-like chili pepper.

Crafting:

- Bullet-like Chili Pepper -> Chili Bullet

Chili bullets will disappear two seconds after they are fired.

### Chili Bullet Gun

A chili bullet gun is a break-action single-shot firearm that fires chili bullets to attack mobs at a distance.

Crafting (shaped recipe):

    Chili Bullet Pistol
    2x Iron Ingot (i), 1x Chili Bullet (b), and 1x Any Planks (p)
    | i |   |   |
    |   | i |   |
    |   | p | b |

Chili bullet guns can be fired with the same operation as crossbows. Specifically, unloaded guns can be loaded by holding down the right mouse button, and loaded guns can be fired by right-clicking.

Chili bullet guns can have the same enchantments as crossbows, and each gun can have a different appearance, display name, and performance depending on the enchantment it has.

Below is a list of enchantments that guns have and their corresponding display names:

- Piercing - Chili Bullet Rifle
- Multishot - Chili Bullet Shotgun
- Other than above - Chili Bullet Pistol

Chili bullet rifles are highly accurate, and bullets from them pass through the number of entities equal to the Piercing level.

Chili bullet shotguns are less accurate, and they can fire four bullets in a single shot but also have four times the ammunition consumption and wear per shot.

#### Upgrading Guns

A chili bullet gun can be upgraded by using upgrade items.

To upgrade a chili bullet gun, follow these steps:

1. Hold a gun in the off-hand
2. Hold an upgrade item in the main hand
3. Use (right-click) the item in the main hand

Currently, there are three types of upgrade items available.

- Bayonet Upgrade

A bayonet upgrade is an item to upgrade a chili bullet gun to a chili bullet gun with bayonet.

A gun barrel upgrade gives Piercing II to a gun without Piercing and Multishot to a gun with Piercing IV.
