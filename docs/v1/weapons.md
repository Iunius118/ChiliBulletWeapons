## Bullet Chili Arrow

|DANGER|
|:-:|
|ðŸ’¥ **EXPLOSIVE**|

A bullet chili arrow serves as ammunition for bows, crossbows, and dispensers.

When a bullet chili arrow is shot and hits an entity or a block, it causes a small explosion, dealing explosive damage to nearby entities.

![Attack with bullet chili arrow 1](../media/item/misc/attack_with_chili_arrow_1.png)
![Attack with bullet chili arrow 2](../media/item/misc/attack_with_chili_arrow_2.png)

Power enchanted bows increase the explosive power and Multishot enchanted crossbows increase the number of bullet chili arrows shot.

## Chili Bullet

A chili bullet serves as ammunition for chili bullet guns and can be crafted from a bullet-like chili pepper.

![Crafting chili bullet](../media/item/crafting/crafting_chili_bullet.png)

Chili bullets will disappear two seconds after they are shot.

## Chili Bullet Gun

A chili bullet gun is a break-action single-shot gun that shoots chili bullets to attack mobs at a distance.

![Crafting chili bullet gun](../media/item/crafting/crafting_chili_bullet_gun.png)

Chili bullet guns can be shot with the same operation as crossbows. Specifically, unloaded guns can be loaded by holding down the right mouse button, and loaded guns can be shot by right-clicking.

Chili bullet guns can have the same enchantments as crossbows, and each gun can have a different appearance, display name, and performance depending on the enchantment it has.

|Enchantment|Appearances<br/>(Closed/Open)|Display Name|
|-----------|:---------------------------:|------------|
|Piercing|![ ](../media/item/rifle_32.png)![ ](../media/item/rifle_loading_32.png)|Chili Bullet Rifle|
|Multishot|![ ](../media/item/shotgun_32.png)![ ](../media/item/shotgun_loading_32.png)|Chili Bullet Shotgun|
|Other than above|![ ](../media/item/pistol_32.png)![ ](../media/item/pistol_loading_32.png)|Chili Bullet Pistol|

Chili bullet rifles are highly accurate, and bullets from them pass through the number of entities equal to the Piercing level.

Chili bullet shotguns are less accurate, and they can shoot four bullets in a single shot but also have four times the ammunition consumption and wear per shot.

Chili bullet guns can be upgraded by using upgrade items.

To upgrade a chili bullet gun, follow these steps:

1. Hold a gun in the off-hand
2. Hold an upgrade item in the main hand
3. Use (right-click) the item in the main hand
