## Weapons
### Chili Bullet
A chili bullet serves as ammunition for chili bullet guns and can be crafted from a bullet-like chili pepper.

Crafting:
- Bullet-like Chili Pepper -> Chili Bullet

Chili bullets will disappear two seconds after they are fired.

### Chili Bullet Gun
A chili bullet gun is a break-action single-shot firearm that fires chili bullets to attack mobs at a distance.

Crafting (shaped recipe):
- 2x Iron Ingot (i) + 1x Chili Bullet (b) + 1x Any Planks (p) -> Chili Bullet Pistol
| i |   |   |
|   | i |   |
|   | p | b |

Chili bullet guns can be fired with the same operation as crossbows. Empty guns can be loaded by holding down the right mouse button, and loaded guns can be fired by right-clicking.

Chili bullet guns can have the same enchantments as crossbows, and each gun can have a different appearance and display name depending on the enchantment it has.

Below is a list of enchantments that guns have and their corresponding display names:
- Piercing - Chili Bullet Rifle
- Multishot - Chili Bullet Shotgun
- Other than above - Chili Bullet Pistol

Chili bullet rifles are highly accurate, and bullets from them pass through the number of entities equal to the Piercing level.

Chili bullet shotguns are less accurate, and they can fire four bullets in a single shot but also have four times the ammunition consumption and wear per shot.

### Chili Bullet Machine Gun
A chili bullet machine gun is a gun for creative mode players and can only be obtained from the creative mode tab or command.
