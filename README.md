![Growing chili pepper crops](docs/media/block/misc/chili_pepper_crops.png)

Breaking the final stage produces 1 to 3 curved chili peppers and 1 to 3 bullet-like chili peppers.

## Crop Farming

### Chili Pepper Seeds

Chili pepper seeds can be obtained from curved chili pepper that can be obtained by breaking short grass or mature chili pepper crops.

When extracting chili pepper seeds from a curved chili pepper, use a crafting table or the player's crafting grid.

### Chili Pepper Crops

Chili pepper seeds can be planted on farmland and the crops will grow to stage eight.

Different stages of crop growth:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|![1st stage](docs/media/block/chili_pepper_stage0_32.png)|![2nd stage](docs/media/block/chili_pepper_stage1_32.png)|![3rd stage](docs/media/block/chili_pepper_stage2_32.png)|![4th stage](docs/media/block/chili_pepper_stage3_32.png)|![5th stage](docs/media/block/chili_pepper_stage4_32.png)|![6th stage](docs/media/block/chili_pepper_stage5_32.png)|![7th stage](docs/media/block/chili_pepper_stage6_32.png)|![8th stage](docs/media/block/chili_pepper_stage7_32.png)|

Chili peppers can be harvested from the crop in the final growth stage.

Items produced when crops are broken at each stage:

|Stage|Drop Items|Quantity|

If harvested with Fortune enchanted tool, the number of chili peppers dropped would increase.

![Crafting fried chili peppers](docs/media/item/crafting/crafting_fried_chili_pepper.png)

## Weapons

### Chili Bullet

A chili bullet serves as ammunition for chili bullet guns and can be crafted from a bullet-like chili pepper.

![Crafting chili bullet](docs/media/item/crafting/crafting_chili_bullet.png)

Chili bullets will disappear two seconds after they are fired.

### Chili Bullet Gun

A chili bullet gun is a break-action single-shot firearm that fires chili bullets to attack mobs at a distance.

![Crafting chili bullet gun](docs/media/item/crafting/crafting_chili_bullet_gun.png)

Chili bullet guns can be fired with the same operation as crossbows. Empty guns can be loaded by holding down the right mouse button, and loaded guns can be fired by right-clicking.

Chili bullet guns can have the same enchantments as crossbows, and each gun can have a different appearance and display name depending on the enchantment it has.

|Enchantment|Appearance<br/>(Closed/Open)|Display Name|
|-----------|:--------------------------:|------------|
|Piercing|![ ](docs/media/item/rifle_32.png)![ ](docs/media/item/rifle_loading_32.png)|Chili Bullet Rifle|
|Multishot|![ ](docs/media/item/shotgun_32.png)![ ](docs/media/item/shotgun_loading_32.png)|Chili Bullet Shotgun|
|Other than above|![ ](docs/media/item/pistol_32.png)![ ](docs/media/item/pistol_loading_32.png)|Chili Bullet Pistol|

Chili bullet rifles are highly accurate, and bullets from them pass through the number of entities equal to the Piercing level.

Chili bullet shotguns are less accurate, and they can fire four bullets in a single shot but also have four times the ammunition consumption and wear per shot.
