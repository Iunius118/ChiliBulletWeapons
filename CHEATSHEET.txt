## Weapons

### Bullet Chili Arrow

A bullet chili arrow serves as ammunition for bows, crossbows, and dispensers.

Crafting (shapeless recipe):

- Arrow + Bullet-like Chili Pepper -> Bullet Chili Arrow
- Arrow + Chili Bullet -> Bullet Chili Arrow

When a bullet chili arrow is shot and hits an entity or a block, it causes a small explosion, dealing explosive damage to nearby entities.

Power enchanted bows increase the explosive power and Multishot enchanted crossbows increase the number of bullet chili arrows shot.

### Chili Bullet

A chili bullet serves as ammunition for chili bullet guns and can be crafted from a bullet-like chili pepper.

Crafting:

- Bullet-like Chili Pepper -> Chili Bullet

Chili bullets will disappear two seconds after they are fired.

### Chili Bullet Gun

A chili bullet gun is a break-action single-shot firearm that fires chili bullets to attack mobs at a distance.

Crafting (shaped recipe):

    Chili Bullet Pistol
    2x Iron Ingot (i), 1x Chili Bullet (b), and 1x Any Planks (p)
    | i |   |   |
    |   | i |   |
    |   | p | b |

Chili bullet guns can be fired with the same operation as crossbows.
Specifically, unloaded guns can be loaded by holding down the right mouse button, and loaded guns can be fired by right-clicking.

Chili bullet guns can have the same enchantments as crossbows, and each gun can have a different appearance, display name, and performance depending on the enchantment it has.

Below is a list of enchantments that guns have and their corresponding display names:

- Piercing - Chili Bullet Rifle
- Multishot - Chili Bullet Shotgun
- Other than above - Chili Bullet Pistol

Chili bullet rifles are highly accurate, and bullets from them pass through the number of entities equal to the Piercing level.

Chili bullet shotguns are less accurate, and they can fire four bullets in a single shot but also have four times the ammunition consumption and wear per shot.

#### Upgrading Guns

Chili bullet guns can be upgraded by using upgrade items.

To upgrade a chili bullet gun, follow these steps:

1. Hold a gun in the off-hand
2. Hold an upgrade item in the main hand
3. Use (right-click) the item in the main hand

Currently, there are three types of upgrade items available.

- Bayonet Upgrade
- Gun Barrel Upgrade
- Gun Mechanism Upgrade

A bayonet upgrade is an item to upgrade a chili bullet gun to a chili bullet gun with bayonet.

A gun barrel upgrade gives Piercing II to a gun without Piercing and Multishot to a gun with Piercing IV.

A gun mechanism upgrade gives Quick Charge I to a gun without Quick Charge.

Crafting (shaped recipe):

    Bayonet Upgrade
    2x Iron Ingot (i), 1x Stick (s), and 6x Chili Bullet (b)
    | b | b | b |
    | i | i | s |
    | b | b | b |

    Gun Barrel Upgrade

### Chili Bullet Gun with Bayonet

A chili bullet gun with bayonet is a chili bullet gun with a bayonet fitted and can deal 6 (heart Ã— 3) damage in melee combat.

Crafting (shapeless recipe):

- Bayonet Upgrade + Any chili bullet gun -> Chili Bullet Pistol with Bayonet

Bayonet upgrade items can be used to make a chili bullet gun with bayonet retaining the enchantments.

Each chili bullet gun with bayonet can also have a different appearance, display name, and performance depending on the enchantment it has.

Below is a list of enchantments that guns have and their corresponding display names:

- Piercing - Chili Bullet Rifle with Bayonet
- Multishot - Chili Bullet Shotgun with Bayonet
- Other than above - Chili Bullet Pistol with Bayonet

### Chili Bullet Machine Gun

A chili bullet machine gun is a gun for creative mode players and can only be obtained from the creative mode tab or command.

## Configuration

The configuration is saved in file `config/chilibulletweapons.toml`.

### Common

```toml
# The common section contains configuration values referenced by both the server and the client.
# In multiplayer mode, server-side values are used.
[common]

# A Boolean value of canShotgunMultiHit represents whether a single target can be damaged multiple times at once by bullets fired from a shotgun.
# If set to false, a single target will take damage from only one bullet at the same time.
canShotgunMultiHit = true

# A real number between 0 and 8 of chiliArrowDamageMultiplier represents the multiplier of the explosive power of bullet chili arrows.
chiliArrowDamageMultiplier = 1.0

# A non-negative real number of chiliBulletBaseDamage represents the base damage amount of a chili bullet fired from a gun.
# If set to 0, chili bullets will do no damage.
# Formula for chili bullet damage (chiliBulletBaseDamage > 0):
#   speed (initial) = 3 (pistols/shotguns) or 4 (rifles)
#   minDamage = ceil(speed * speed * chiliBulletBaseDamage)
#   maxDamage = floor(minDamage * 1.5) + 1
#   damage = a random integer between minDamage and maxDamage
chiliBulletBaseDamage = 0.85
```
