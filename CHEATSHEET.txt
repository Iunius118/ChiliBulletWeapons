Chili pepper seeds can be crafted from curved chili pepper.

### 3. Grow Chili Pepper Crops

Chili pepper seeds can be placed on farmland by right-clicking, where they grow through eight stages.

## Farming

### Chili Pepper Seeds (CBW)

Chili pepper seeds can be obtained from curved chili pepper that can be obtained by breaking short grass or mature chili pepper crops.

When extracting chili pepper seeds from a curved chili pepper, use a crafting table or the player’s crafting grid.

Crafting:

- Curved Chili Pepper -> Chili Pepper Seeds

### Chili Pepper Crops (CBW)

Chili pepper seeds can be planted on farmland and the crops will grow to stage eight.

Chili peppers can be harvested from the crop in the seventh or final growth stage.

Items produced when crops are broken at each stage:

- Stage 1-6 - 1x Chili Pepper Seeds (CBW)
- Stage  7  - 1-3x Curved Green Chili Pepper
- Stage  8  - 1-3x Curved Chili Pepper and 1-3x Bullet-like Chili Pepper

If harvested with Fortune enchanted tool, the number of chili peppers dropped will increase.

For more information on the use of curved chili peppers, refer to CBW Chili Peppers and Foods mod.

### Composting

The following item can be added to composters:

## Weapons

### Bullet Chili Arrow

A bullet chili arrow serves as ammunition for bows, crossbows, and dispensers.

Crafting (shapeless recipe):

- Arrow + Bullet-like Chili Pepper -> Bullet Chili Arrow
- Arrow + Chili Bullet -> Bullet Chili Arrow

When a bullet chili arrow is shot and hits an entity or a block, it causes a small explosion, dealing explosive damage to nearby entities.

Power enchanted bows increase the explosive power and Multishot enchanted crossbows increase the number of bullet chili arrows shot.

### Chili Bullet

A chili bullet serves as ammunition for chili bullet guns and can be crafted from a bullet-like chili pepper.

Crafting:

- Bullet-like Chili Pepper -> Chili Bullet

Chili bullets will disappear two seconds after they are fired.

### Chili Bullet Gun

A chili bullet gun is a break-action single-shot gun that shoots chili bullets to attack mobs at a distance.

Crafting (shaped recipe):

    Chili Bullet Pistol
    2x Iron Ingot (i), 1x Chili Bullet (b), and 1x any planks (p)
    | i |   |   |
    |   | i |   |
    |   | p | b |

Chili bullet guns can be shot with the same operation as crossbows.
Specifically, unloaded guns can be loaded by holding down the right mouse button, and loaded guns can be shot by right-clicking.

The following enchantments can be applied to chili bullet guns:

- Unbreaking
- Mending
- Curse of Vanishing

A chili bullet gun is named Chili Bullet Pistol when crafted, but the display name and appearance may change with upgrades.

The display names and upgrades are listed below:

- Chili Bullet Pistol     - A gun not yet upgraded with any gun barrel upgrades and bayonet upgrades
- Chili Bullet Rifle      - Upgrade a pistol with a gun barrel upgrade
- Chili Bullet Volley Gun - Upgrade a pistol with 2 gun barrel upgrades
- Chili Bullet Pistol with Bayonet     - Upgrade a pistol with a bayonet upgrade
- Chili Bullet Rifle with Bayonet      - Upgrade a pistol with a gun barrel upgrade and a bayonet upgrade
- Chili Bullet Volley Gun with Bayonet - Upgrade a pistol with 2 gun barrel upgrades and a bayonet upgrade

A chili bullet rifle is highly accurate and powerful, and a bullet from it pass through three entities.

A chili bullet volley gun is less accurate, and it can fire four bullets in a single shot but also have four times the ammunition consumption and wear per shot.

A chili bullet gun with bayonet is a chili bullet gun with a bayonet fitted and can deal 6 (heart × 3) damage in melee combat.

A chili bullet gun with custom name will have a reduced chance of durability reduction.

## Configuration

The configuration is saved in file `config/chilibulletweapons.toml`.

### Common

```toml
# The common section contains configuration values referenced by both the server and the client.
# In multiplayer mode, server-side values are used.
[common]

# A Boolean value of canMultishotMultiHit represents whether a single target can be damaged multiple times at once by bullets shot from a volley gun.
# If set to false, a single target will take damage from only one bullet at the same time.
canMultishotMultiHit = true

# A real number between 0 and 8 of chiliArrowDamageMultiplier represents the multiplier of the explosive power of bullet chili arrows.
chiliArrowDamageMultiplier = 1.0

# A non-negative real number of chiliBulletBaseDamage represents the base damage amount of a chili bullet fired from a gun.
# If set to 0, chili bullets will do no damage.
# Formula for chili bullet damage (only when chiliBulletBaseDamage > 0):
#   speed (initial) = 3 (pistol/volley gun/machine gun) or 4 (rifle)
#   minDamage = ceil(speed * speed * chiliBulletBaseDamage)
#   maxDamage = floor(minDamage * 1.5) + 1
#   damage = a random integer between minDamage and maxDamage
chiliBulletBaseDamage = 0.85
```
